            <h1>So Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Kaiser Paul Nonog.</p>
            <p>A student from University of the Cordilleras. Soon to be graduating Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and passionate in making awesome layouts of pictures and websites!</p>
            <p>My passion is playing the guitar, and I've been immersed in this journey since 2018. Music has been a profound part of my life, and with every strum of the strings, I find a unique form of self-expression. I also am into reading manga as it's a vibrant and captivating world that has been an integral part of my life for years. Since the moment I picked up my first manga, I've been enthralled by the enchanting blend of storytelling, artistry, and emotion that these graphic novels offer.</p>
            <p>I've been also editing and layouting at Adobe Photoshop since 2018 and have been tasked for a commission various of times. Photo editing played a big part of my high school as it has helped me countless of times, which weirdly enough, just started for fun and ultimately resulting into passion.</p>
